    <h3>Normal paragraph example</h3>
    <p>
      Jane Austen's "Pride and Prejudice" masterfully captures the intricate dance of courtship and the complex
      interplay of
      societal expectations and personal desires. The novel's enduring appeal lies in its rich characterizations,
      especially
      the spirited and intelligent Elizabeth Bennet and the proud yet ultimately honorable Mr. Darcy. Austen's keen
      observations
      on class and morality are woven with wit and irony, making the story as relevant today as it was in the early 19th
      century.
      The nuanced development of Elizabeth and Darcy's relationship, from misunderstanding and prejudice to mutual
      respect and love,
      is particularly compelling, showcasing Austen's genius in creating timeless romance and social commentary.

    <h3>Colored paragraph example</h3>
    <p class="colored">
      Moreover, the novel delves into themes of individual growth and self-awareness.<br>
      Elizabeth's from arrogance to humility are central to the story's moral fabric.
